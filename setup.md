1. [Create an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
	* AWS offers a 12 month Free trial.

1. [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
	1. You'll need python 3 to get access to the latest AWS CLI commands.

1. [Install Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

1. [Install ./jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
	* This will quickly become one of your favorite command line utilities. 😎

## One Time Set Up
	
1. [Create an AWS IAM User in your AWS Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)
	* It's bad practice to use your AWS root account.
	* I recommend following the console instructions.
	* When you get to the "Set permissions" step, attach an existing policy and choose "AdministratorAccess".
	  You can change the access at anytime.
	  AWS will prompt you when you don't have sufficient access to a resource.

1. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration)
	* Remember your region for configuration later.

1. Open a command line app.
	* Mac: Terminal
	* Windows: Git Bash
	
1. Download Project Source Code
	* Some of these steps may be superfluous for experienced developers.
	For those less experienced coders, I recommend following these steps verbatim.
	
	1. Run `cd ~` to navigate to your home directory.
	1. Run `mkdir Developer` to create a directory to keep development related things.
	1. Run `cd Developer` to navigate into the Developer directory.
	1. Run `mkdir git` to create a directory to keep code cloned through git.
	1. Run `cd git` to navigate into the git directory.
	1. Run `git clone https://github.com/xilution/xilution-react-todomvc` to download the code for this example.
	1. Run `cd xilution-react-todomvc` to navigate into the directory where the code for this example has been downloaded.

1. Install Node.js 10.16.3
	1. From within the 'xilution-react-todomvc' directory, run `nvm install` to install the version of Node.js used by the example.

1. Download Project Dependencies
	1. From within the 'xilution-react-todomvc' directory, run `yarn` to install Node.Js dependencies.

1. Create a `config.mk` file to hold build settings
	* Look up your Xilution Client Id through the [Xilution Customer Admin Portal](https://test.portal.xilution.com).
	  Use the credentials you used to create your Xilution Subscriber Account.
	1. Run `touch config.mk` to create the file.
	1. Run `echo XILUTION_CLIENT_ID={REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-CLIENT-ID} >> config.mk` to save your xilution client identifier to the config.
	1. Run `echo AWS_STAGING_BUCKET={REPLACE-WITH-A-UNIQUE-STAGING-BUCKET-NAME} >> config.mk` to save a staging bucket name to the config.
		* AWS S3 bucket names must be unique across all AWS S3 buckets. We recommend prefixing your bucket name with your organization name to prevent naming conflicts.
	1. Run `echo AWS_WEBSITE_BUCKET={REPLACE-WITH-A-UNIQUE-WEBSITE-BUCKET-NAME} >> config.mk` to save a website bucket name to the config.
		* AWS S3 bucket names must be unique across all AWS S3 buckets. We recommend prefixing your bucket name with your organization name to prevent naming conflicts.
	1. Run `echo AWS_REGION={REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-AWS-REGION} >> config.mk` to save your AWS account's region to the config.

## Provision and Deploy

1. Open a command line app.
	* Mac: Terminal
	* Windows: Git Bash

1. Provision and Deploy Backend Resources
	1. Run `make provision-base` to provision the base AWS resources.
		* See [./aws/cloud-formation/template-base.yml](https://github.com/xilution/xilution-react-todomvc/blob/master/aws/cloud-formation/template-base.yml)
		* Checkout the 'xilution-todomvc-base' stack using the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
		* This step takes a couple of minutes to complete.
	1. Run `make build-backend` to build the backend resources.
	1. Run `make deploy-backend` to deploy the backend resources to your AWS account.
		* Provisions API Gateway and Lambda resources.
		* See [./aws/cloud-formation/template-sam.yml](https://github.com/xilution/xilution-react-todomvc/blob/master/aws/cloud-formation/template-sam.yml)
		* Checkout the 'xilution-todomvc-sam' stack using the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
	1. Run `make show-backend-url` to see the URL of the backend RESTful web service.
	1. Run `make put-types` to register JSON schema used by this example with Xilution - Basics - Beagily.
		* You will be prompted for credentials.
		  Use the credentials you used to create your Xilution account.

1. Deploy Frontend Resource
	1. Run `make build-frontend` to build the frontend resources.
	1. Run `make deploy-frontend` to deploy the frontend resources.
	1. Run `make show-frontend-url` to see the URL of the frontend application.
	1. Copy the front end URL and paste it into a browser.
		* You should see the login for for the TodoMVC app.

👏👏👏 The example should now be up and running in AWS. 👏👏👏

## To Test

1. Open a command line app.
	* Mac: Terminal
	* Windows: Git Bash

1. To Run Linter and Unit Tests
	1. Run `yarn test` to run the linter and run unit tests.

1. To Run the App Locally
	1. Run `make dev` to run the app locally.
		* make is necessary to automatically inject the backend url.

1. User Acceptance Testing
	1. Run `make show-frontend-url` to see the URL of the frontend application.
	1. Copy the front end URL and paste it into a browser.
	1. Run through the different use cases
		* Login User
			* Use your Xilution user credentials
		* View Todos
		* Create/Update/Delete Todos

## Troubleshooting

1. Backend
	* CloudWatch Logs
		* Open the [AWS CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home).
			* Lambdas
				* Click Logs in the left hand menu.
				* Search for '/aws/lambda' to see a list of provisioned Lambda functions.
				* Choose the Lambda function associated with the endpoint giving you trouble.
				* Browse through the logs for error messages.
				* I've found it most effective to find error messages by time.
			* API Gateway
				* Finding CloudWatch logs for API Gateway is a little trickier than Lambda.
				* Open the [AWS APIGateway console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home)
				* Find the API ID for the `xilution-todo-sam` API.
				* Go back to the AWS CloudWatch console.
				* Click Logs in the left hand menu.
				* Search for 'API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{REPLACE-WITH-API-ID}/Prod'

1. Frontend
	* Google Chrome
		* [Open the Chrome Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/)
		* Errors appear in the Console tab and will have a Error ID.
		* You can get a more detailed description of the error by finding the Error ID in CloudWatch Logs.
		* Also use the Network tab to observe how the app is interacting with the API.

1. Bugs
	* If you have found an issue with 'xilution-react-todomvc', [please submit a bug](https://github.com/xilution/xilution-react-todomvc/issues).

## Deprovisioning

1. Open a command line app.
	* Mac: Terminal
	* Windows: Git Bash

1. Deprovision Resources

			* [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/)
			* [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)

1. Why React?
	* React was chosen for this example's frontend because of its pervasiveness and (most importantly) its [unit testability](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react.html).
	* Other [JavaScript frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) like [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) could be used as the frontend for this example.

1. Is the backend necessary?
	* The backend is useful for abstracting secrets and domain specific functionality from the frontend.

1. Why Node.js for the backend? Are there alternative programming languages?
	* Node.js was selected for the backend of this example to provided a consistent programming experience between the frontend and the backend.
	* [AWS Lambda supports many other programming languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-app.html) including [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)).

1. Can this example run on other public cloud platforms?
	* In theory, yes.
	  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) offer similar types of web hosting and compute services needed to run this example.
	  Eventually, I would like to develop [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) templates for several different public cloud platforms.
	  If you're passionate about your cloud platform and would like to see it incorporated in this example, I invite you to submit a pull request.

1. What about the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework?
	* I personally don't have experience working with the Serverless framework, but I hear good things.
	  The pervasiveness of the framework warrants a mention in this example's FAQ.
	  I [applaud the maintainers of the framework](https://serverless.com/company/team/) for their advancement of serverless computing.
	  I would like to learn more about the framework and how it could be incorporated into this example.
	  If you're passionate about the Serverless framework or other similar frameworks, I invite you to submit a pull request.

1. Do I have to use Xilution APIaaS?
	* Nope.
	  You can use just about any persistance model in your backend implementation including other API as a Service providers.
	  AWS [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) are valid alternatives if you choose to provision and maintain your own persistence infrastructure.
	  However, I think you'll reconsider investing in a relational or noSQL database and choose API as a Service when you consider the productivity gains that a serverless architecture model has already afforded you.
	  In a way, API as a Service is like the icing on the cake.
	  If you're interested in learning more about API as a Service, [this blog article Ed Shelley](https://blog.chartmogul.com/api-based-saas/) is a good place to start.
